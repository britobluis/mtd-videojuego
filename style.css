/* Simple JS game I've been developping in my free time at work, using canvas. Infrequent updates, given that I'm developping it in my free time at work :) */


/* TO DO:

Development wise: 1) monster-tank collision detection loop => game over. implement lives

Bugs:
1) the firing ball goes through the blocks

2) the blocks come in groups of three that are too far apart => make it more smooth and regular

3) Currently, if the tank touches the blocks sideways and not head first => game over. Maybe better to just stop the tank from moving further along sideways (& game over only if head-first collision)?
